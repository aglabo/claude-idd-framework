# @(#): E2E tests for /idd:issue:push complete workflow
#
# @file idd-issue-push.e2e.spec.sh
# @brief End-to-end tests for complete Issue push workflow
# @description
#   E2E test suite for /idd:issue:push command main routine.
#   Tests complete workflow from prerequisites through GitHub push to next steps.
#
#   Test framework: ShellSpec
#   BDD hierarchy: Given (feature) → When (action) → Then (expected result)
#   Test approach: Mock external dependencies, execute main routine, verify state
#
#   Covered workflows:
#   - Complete new issue creation pipeline
#   - Complete existing issue update pipeline
#   - Error handling and exit codes
#   - Output validation and next steps
