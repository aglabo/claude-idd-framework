- Use the documents in `.serena/memories/` for detailed knowledge about code style, project structure, tool usage, and task completion criteria.
- Check `.lsmcp/memories/` for the latest project overview and XCP implementation status.
- Consult `handover.md` to understand the current status, outstanding work, and any handover specifics.
- Treat the above resources as required reading before starting or continuing any task, and keep them open as reference while working.
